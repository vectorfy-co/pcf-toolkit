# Roadmap

This roadmap describes **planned and potential** improvements. Timelines are intentionally flexible.

## Near-term focus

- Expand docs and example coverage
- Improve proxy diagnostics and OS-specific guidance
- Add more manifest validation hints and error context

## Under consideration

- Versioned schema exports for multiple PCF SDK versions
- Additional proxy automation (auto-detect common build outputs)
- Optional formatting/linting helpers for YAML manifests

Have a request? Open an issue or discussion with a use case and sample manifest.
